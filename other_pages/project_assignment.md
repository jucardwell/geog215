### Introduction

For your final project, you will be presenting the results from a
spatial data analysis in a reproducible format. This analysis will build on skills you have already executed in in-class activities and assignments, as well as the project tasks. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Required Components
-   Create spatial data from non-spatial data (e.g. join)
-   Produce descriptive statistics for your variable of interest
-   Produce at least one non-map graphic (for instance, a histogram or scatterplot)
-   Create at least two different maps (which must be in interactive mode)
-   Execute spatial clustering analysis (this should be Moran’s I and LISA)
-   Develop one research question, with appropriate table(s),
    graphic(s), or statistical test results to answer it

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Reproducible

You must organize your analysis such that it is fully reproducible. The most important thing that needs to be done to ensure reproducibility is using relative file paths. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Organization

This is a general breakdown of how your final project may be organized. 

#### *Introduction*

*Should be a broad introduction to your topic and your research question. This should be approximately 2-3 paragraphs. You must include at least two outside data sources (at least one must be a peer-reviewed article).*

#### *Data Preparation*

*Describe data preparation and processing steps required to acquire and prepare your data for analysis. Please **do not** include the code you used to extract the data in your final project report .Rmd document!! This
should be in a separate .Rmd file (see Project Task \#1 and 2) that
should be submitted with your final project files.

#### *Data Description and Summary*

*Include descriptive statistics, graph(s), and a plain text description of what you
learned about your data.*

#### *Geographic Distribution and Spatial Clustering*

*Includes map(s), results of clustering analysis, and a plain text
description of what you learned about your data.*

#### *Research Question and Analysis*

*Include your research question. Include a plain text description of
your method to answer the question. Include your answer to the research
question (your interpretation of the statistical test or graphic). You
may want to break this section up into subsections!*

#### *Conclusion*

*Include a summary of the entire project*


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Text Length

The narrative text portion of your final project should be a minimum of
500 words and maximum of 750 words. This is roughly equivalent to 2-3
double-spaced typed pages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Formatting

There is a lot of flexibility regarding formatting your final project. Your final document must be readable and visually pleasing. For instance, you should use clear headers, you should not have code warnings and messages in the output, you may want to hide some of your code chunks in the output, you might want to look into R Markdown themes and the `kable` R package for tables. Your maps should be clear, your figures should have readable, well-described axis labels, your tables should be well-formatted, etc..  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deliverables

Make sure that your .Rmd file knits. When you are finished, zip up your
files/folders (this is extremely easy to do on Mac and Windows
computers). Upload a .zip file that contains all the files required to
perform your analysis on Canvas
